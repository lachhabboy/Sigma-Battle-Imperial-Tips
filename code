		"description": "The Hero-31 in Overwatch is a barrier-tank called Sigma. Jeff Kaplan, the lead game designer described him as a 3-star hero, meaning he’s not a beginner hero and everyone attempting to play Sigma should be prepared to a high learning curve.
                     Today, I’m going to show you exactly how to play Sigma like a Top 300 Overwatch booster.
                     Our clients have seen increases in their Overwatch Skill Rating shortly after reading and practicing a little with their newly learned tips. I promise, it won’t be hard to digest the content. Let’s dive in.",

		"name": "Experimental Barrier",
		"description": "The Experimental barrier is Sigma’s key ability in my opinion. By activating it, you spawn a 1500 HP barrier that keeps moving forward until it hits a wall or you release the button. You can also cancel the ability, recall it and use it again, momentarily.
                    When your Experimental Barrier is active, you cannot fire Hyperspheres, but you can recall the barrier, fire, and spawn the barrier again. Similar to Reinhardt’s barrier, it won’t regenerate it’s HP while it’s active, in order to regenerate your barrier, you need to cancel it. This ability has no cooldown either.",

                     The rock won’t be stopped by D.Va’s Defence Matrix. Yay.
                     Since the rock will knock down people, it means it also interrupts abilities such as McCree’s ultimate, Reinhardt’s charge or Moira’s Coalescence.
                      An amazing combo you can do is knock someone down, and then burst him with Hyperspheres for a total of 200 damage, oof.
                      Another great use of this ability is to interrupt Roadhog’s ultimate",

		"description": "After you slam dunk enemies into the ground, you cannot fly anymore, make sure you positioned yourself well and not above some kind of hole where you can die by falling into it.
                    When the enemies are in the air before you slam dunk them, you can shoot your Hyperspheres at squishy targets to aim for the kill even before the slam dunk
                    Don’t be greedy and never use your ult because you think you can catch every single member in your ultimate. Try to catch some squishies and that will be enough most of the time.
                    You can get stunned when using the ultimate as well. Do not use it recklessly by trying to catch everyone.
                    There are situations where you need to use it defensively, even on one person such as Genji ramming through your backline. Don’t call it a waste if not using it is gonna cost you a team wipe.",

Occasionally though, Blizzard stumble with their cosmetic offerings, rather like they’ve tripped over an invisible dog. Players have been taking to Twitter and Reddit to voice their irritation with support hero Moira’s rather uninspired new legendary skin, based on the classic black and white look of mime artists everywhere. Just like mime artists themselves, it’s not very popular.",
